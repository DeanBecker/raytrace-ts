# raytrace-ts
TypeScript ray tracing implementation.

Mostly made for fun because it certainly isn't performant.

## Build/Run

Build with:
`gulp`
which will start a watch session, compiling after every change.

Then navigate to `./dist/index.html` in your browser to generate an image (largely tested in Chrome).
